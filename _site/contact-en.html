<p>Jekyll is a great tool to create static sites but with static site, there’s no backend to send your data to: that is why it’s hard to put a form on a Jekyll site.</p>

<p>Here listed some resources which provide  a saas service as a backend for forms (contact forms, hiring forms, etc.) to designers and developers like you:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree (also open source, free)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://formkeep.com/guides/contact-form-jekyll">FormKeep</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://getsimpleform.com/">Simple Form</a></li>
