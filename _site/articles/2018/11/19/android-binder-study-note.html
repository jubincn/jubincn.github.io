<h2 id="tldr">TL,DR</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Driver based IPC.</li>
  <li>There is only one copy for Binder IPC and hence its efficient.
    <ul>
      <li>For client: Copy data from user space to kernel space, 1 time.</li>
      <li>For server: Using mmap to share response memory, 0 time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-find-service">How to find service?</h2>
<p>Binder token is used to locate service and they are registered in ServiceManager. There is a default locater with fixed token(seems to be 0) and client will ask locater for address.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-binder-instead-of-other-linux-ipc">Why use Binder instead of other Linux IPC?</h2>
<p>Shared memory is more efficient but its also error-prone. Pipe and message queue is less efficient since they need 2 memory copy.</p>

<h2 id="security-model">Security model</h2>
<p>Based on UID and PID, and filters to guarantee security.</p>

<h2 id="async-or-sync">Async or sync?</h2>
<p>Synchronous.</p>

<h2 id="reference-counting">Reference Counting</h2>
<p>Since Binder object is shared by another process, Binder use reference counting to track it.</p>
