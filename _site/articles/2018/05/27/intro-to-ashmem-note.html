  <li>Ashmem memory dies when the process dies.</li>
  <li>Ashmem allows fork first and then share memory.</li>

<p>Ashmem is short for Android Shared Memory.</p>

  <li>Share memory between process.</li>
  <li>A mechanism for Linux to recalim memory if it find itself under memory pressure.</li>

<p>I didn’t understand the whole process. It seems has something to do with binder and mmap. Read <a href="http://notjustburritos.tumblr.com/post/21442138796/an-introduction-to-android-shared-memory">original post</a> for more details.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The ashmem memory dies when the process dies.</strong> (No chance killing process with some memory reserves)</li>
  <li><strong>Ashmem allows a process share memory after it has already forked</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-does-ashmem-save-memory">How does ashmem save memory?</h3>
<font color="red">important</font>

<p>Asmem allows a process to designate some pages of its memory as reclaimable. This is called unpinning a section of memory.</p>

<p>When the section is unpinned, OS can reclaim the pages and use them if memory goes low.</p>

<p>The process can pin these pages back. The driver will return “ASHMEM_NOT_PURGED” or “ASHMEM_WAS_PURGED” to indicate whether these pages are reclaimed while they are unpinned. If they are purged, the data is gone. This is good for handling cache data.</p>

<p>Using ashmem, a process can cache gressively without warrying about memory pressure.</p>

<h3 id="how-ashmem-decide-when-to-claim-memory">How ashmem decide when to claim memory?</h3>
<p>Ashmem registers a shrinker and call the shrink function when memory is low, telling it how many pages it want freed.</p>

<p>Ashmem reclaim unpinned pages using LRU algorithm.</p>

<p><em>Ashmem will free an entire section of memory.</em></p>
