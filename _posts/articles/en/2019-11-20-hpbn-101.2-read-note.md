### Three way handshake
1. SYN

  Client generate a random number x, send a 'SYN' with x to server.

2. SYNACK

  Server add 1 to x, and generate a random number y then send 'SYN' with y and 'ACK' with x + 1.

3. ACK

  Client add 1 to y, and send 'ACK' with y + 1 to server.

### ReadNote
1. Random number is to identify request.
2. By three way handshake, client and server both send a syn and ack, which means the send and receive function of two sides works properly.
3. The three way handshake impacts network performance since each TCP connection will have a full roundtrip of latency. To send a request from New York to London, minimum cost will be 56 milliseconds.
