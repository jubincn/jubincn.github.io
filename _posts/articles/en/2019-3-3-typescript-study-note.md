## `var`, `let, `const` and `readonly`
There are two types of scopes in javascript, that is:
* Local scope(Function scope)
* Global scope

Variable declared as `var` has a local scope while `var` has a global scope.
Variable declared as `const` is a constant.
Property use `readonly` while variable use `const`.


## `interface` vs `class`
1. `class` is a concept in javascript, while `interface` only exists in typescript. The typescript compiler use interface solely for type checking.
2. interfaces which has same name will merge
